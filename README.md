## About Me.

Hello I am Brendan Jenkins | LinkedIn: [@brendanwjenkins](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brendanwjenkins/)

I am currently a graduate student in the Master of Science in Data Science program at the University of San Francisco, with an expected graduation date of July 2022.

I am currently a Data Science Intern for the New York Mets, where I have been working on improving their defensive positioning model.

Many of the projects that I have completed in this program are private. If you would like to know more about a project listed below, feel free to contact with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brendanwjenkins/) and I will be happy to walk you through the project.

Before attending graduate school, I played two season of professional baseball and attented the University of San Francisco where I earned my Bachelor of Science in Mathematics while serving as the closing pitcher for the baseball team.

## Machine Learning Projects
[Kaggle Competition (within USF cohort):](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/predicting-implicit-ratings-usfca-2022)
- Predicted implicit rating for users using Booking.com data. Utilized matrix factorization and a dynamic learning rate to achieve a test log loss score of 0.41. Placed 9th out of 55 teams. 

Decision Tree Project:
- Created a decision tree model that matched the performance of scikit-learn's decision tree library.
- This program would allow the user to create a decision tree object and then pass in the data by calling the fit function. Then my function would find the best possible splits in the data that minimized the appropriate loss function. 

Random Forest Project:
- Expanded upon my decision tree project to build a random forest library.
- This program would allow the user to create a random forest ensamble and then pass in the data by calling the fit function.
- Then based on the parameter specifications, my function would find an ensamble of trees, each trained on a bootstrapped sample of the training data.

## Reports
K-Means Cluster:
- Implemented the K-Means algorithm by hand to create a report about how K-Means works and its potential pitfalls.

Feature Importance:
- Created a detailed notebook that explored different feature importance and feature selection techniques.
- Through this I was able to explore some of the downsides of scikit-learns built in feature importance functions.

A/B Testing:
- Utilized statistal techniques to conduct a multi-factor experiment on generated data.
- Used the generated data to find the optimal values of our factors to maximized user engagement.
